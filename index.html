                        <p>For as long as I can remember my passion and love for technology has always been there. There wasn’t a piece of electronic in the house that I did not want to take apart and examine how it works. The idea of being able to invent
                            or create solutions to a given problem that will also drive us further toward the future is exciting!<br><br> As of my writing this I have been working in IT for almost five years. Within that time I have worked for companies
                            as small as 50 people to as 1000+. This has enabled me exposure things such as requirements gathering, data analysis, server & application management, process improvement, and software configuration. No matter the technology
                            my goal is always to provide solutions to a given problem.<br><br> As it relates to my education, I am a graduate of the University of South Florida located in Tampa, FL. It was at USF where I obtained my bachelor of science
                            in Information Technology. Through my formal education, I gained knowledge in web development, database management, network & server management, business analysis, and software development. Informally I have been and always
                            will be a student of technology always staying in tune with the cutting edge or next advancement. </p>
